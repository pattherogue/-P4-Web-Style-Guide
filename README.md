Unit 04 Project

In this project, I was responsible for converting CSS into Sass by splitting the code into several Sass partial files. 

I was responsible for looking out for the following repeated values (length units, colors, etc.) throughout the CSS and storing them in Sass variables.

After completion of this project, I now have a useful Sass micro-framework to quickly prototype other websites.
